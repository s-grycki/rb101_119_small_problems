=begin
Take a look at the following code:

name = 'Bob'
save_name = name
name = 'Alice'
puts name, save_name

What does this code print out? Think about it for a moment before continuing.

If you said that code printed

Alice
Bob

you are 100% correct, and the answer should come as no surprise.
Now, let's look at something a bit different:

name = 'Bob'
save_name = name
name.upcase!
puts name, save_name

What does this print out? Can you explain these results?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


BOB
BOB

This happens because the same value pointed to by both variables in memory
is being mutated.
